# Recently Played Feature Implementation

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of the Recently Played feature using TanStack Query, cookies for persistence, and user-specific storage keys.

## Architecture

### 1. Enhanced Music Provider (`MusicProviderWithRecentlyPlayed.tsx`)
- Wraps the original `MusicPlayerProvider` with recently played functionality
- Automatically tracks when tracks are played via `playTrack` and `playPlaylist` methods
- Provides backward compatibility with existing components

### 2. Recently Played Hook (`useRecentlyPlayed.ts`)
- Uses TanStack Query for state management and caching
- Stores data in cookies with user-specific keys: `melodious-recently-played-{walletAddress}`
- Implements automatic deduplication and limits to 10 most recent tracks
- Provides loading states and error handling

### 3. Cookie Storage Strategy
- **Key Format**: `melodious-recently-played-{walletAddress}`
- **Expiration**: 30 days
- **Security**: Uses `sameSite: 'strict'` and `secure` in production
- **Data Structure**: JSON array of Track objects

## Key Features

### Automatic Tracking
- Tracks are automatically added when played via `playTrack()` or `playPlaylist()`
- Prevents duplicates by removing existing entries before adding
- Maintains chronological order (most recent first)

### User-Specific Storage
- Each wallet address gets its own recently played list
- Data persists across browser sessions
- Automatically loads when wallet is connected

### Performance Optimizations
- TanStack Query caching with 5-minute stale time
- Optimistic updates for immediate UI feedback
- Efficient cookie operations with error handling

## Usage

### In Components
```typescript
import { useMusicPlayer } from '@/contexts/melodious/MusicProviderWithRecentlyPlayed';

function MyComponent() {
  const { 
    recentlyPlayed, 
    isLoadingRecentlyPlayed, 
    clearRecentlyPlayed 
  } = useMusicPlayer();

  return (
    <div>
      {recentlyPlayed.map(track => (
        <div key={track.id}>{track.title}</div>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Dashboard Integration
The dashboard (`/listener/dashboard`) now displays:
- Real recently played tracks instead of hardcoded data
- Loading states while fetching data
- Empty state when no tracks have been played
- Clear button to reset the recently played list

## Migration Notes

### Updated Imports
All components now import from `MusicProviderWithRecentlyPlayed` instead of the original `MusicProvider`:

```typescript
// Before
import { useMusicPlayer } from '@/contexts/melodious/MusicProvider';

// After
import { useMusicPlayer } from '@/contexts/melodious/MusicProviderWithRecentlyPlayed';
```

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing `useMusicPlayer` functionality remains unchanged
- Additional recently played features are seamlessly integrated
- No breaking changes to existing components

## Dependencies

### Added Packages
- `js-cookie`: Cookie management
- `@types/js-cookie`: TypeScript definitions

### Existing Dependencies
- `@tanstack/react-query`: State management and caching
- `thirdweb/react`: Wallet connection and user identification

## Future Enhancements

1. **Timestamps**: Add play timestamps for more detailed history
2. **Play Count**: Track how many times each song has been played
3. **Analytics**: Integrate with backend analytics for user behavior insights
4. **Sync Across Devices**: Store recently played data on backend for cross-device sync
5. **Advanced Filtering**: Filter by date range, artist, or genre

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Connect wallet on dashboard
2. Play various tracks from the music library
3. Verify tracks appear in "Recently Played" section
4. Test deduplication by playing the same track multiple times
5. Test persistence by refreshing the page
6. Test clear functionality
7. Test with different wallet addresses

### Edge Cases Handled
- No wallet connected (graceful degradation)
- Cookie storage failures (error logging)
- Invalid JSON in cookies (fallback to empty array)
- Network issues (TanStack Query retry logic)
